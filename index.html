                        still young. Changsha is the capital of the Hunan Province and the 15th largest city in China.
                        This place is known for being the birthplace of China's most famous president and home to the
                        Yuelue Mountain amidst the bustling city. I lived in the "city-of-no sleep" for more than four
                        years until moving to Canada.</p>

                        <h3>My Family, Traditions, and Culture</h3>
                        <p>Now, let's talk about my dearest family members. My immediate family here are my mom and my
                            dad. My dad went to Jiangnan University in eastern China. He works in
                            an IT company called Stripe and he works from home. His main interests are gaming—mainly
                            Diablo, Genshin, and some Chinese ones. My mom went to Hunan University
                            and she is currently a stay-at-home mom. She loves reading, studying English, C-dramas,
                            running, and walking.</p>
                        <p>They were both born in the same town, a village called 陈家嘴 (Orange Family's Port). It's a
                            quiet place where I spent a good 1/3 of my time in China. As for me, I'm an only child,
                            though I sometimes wish for the drama of siblings. We celebrate many holidays like Chinese
                            New Year, Dragon Boat Festival, and my favorite, the Mid-Autumn Festival with its
                            mouth-watering mooncakes.</p>

                        <h3>Info About Me as a Baby</h3>
                        <p>When I was around one year old, I solved my first mystery. My mom was secretly eating a snack
                            she deemed "too unhealthy" for me. Suspicious of her silence, I looked her in the eyes and
                            demanded, "Hey, talk to me! Talk to me!" catching her red-handed with crumbs everywhere.</p>
                        <p>Back then, I loved stuffed animals—a cute sheep and a huge orca whale. I also made "cakes"
                            out of coding novels and Rubik's cubes, inspired by a bakery I loved. Kindergarten in China
                            was mostly fooling around; I once stole a teacher's irresistible candy with my friends,
                            turning her ears bright red with anger.</p>

                        <p>Mrs. Tsang, my Grade 6 teacher, taught me to stand up for myself. She even marched me to
                            another class to advocate for missing tryouts. I also learned about friendship through a boy
                            named Mason, who wasn't a true friend, and Alice, who was. Alice moved away, but her
                            kindness—like shouting my name at my door when I was sick—stayed with me. Achievements? I
                            got 85% on my level 5 piano exam and won 1st place in cross-country in Grade 1.</p>

                        <p>Gaming is my main hobby—especially Genshin Impact for its lore and world (though Ella helps
                            with the long quests). I also love Roblox and Minecraft. Beyond screens, I help my mom cook,
                            play basketball (rebounding is my specialty!), and listen to music. My favorite artist is
                            ROSÉ from BLACKPINK (especially "On the Ground" and "APT").</p>
                        <p>Fun facts: I LOVE polar bears (I have a collection of photos) and pineapples are the best
                            fruit in existence. I also take math, piano, and swimming lessons.</p>

                        <p>For high school, I'm aiming for Milliken Mills (IB program) or Markville Secondary.
                            Career-wise? I want to be an architect. I love designing and building, and it combines math,
                            science, and art. Plus, I don't think AI can replace the trust needed in a human-designed
                            home. It pays well too! If not architecture, maybe city planning or interior design.</p>

                    <p>So here is my life up until now. It's been only 12 years and I still have high school,
                        university, and maybe even some diplomas to go through. The future is uncertain, but I have many
                        hopes for it. Thank you for reading!</p>
